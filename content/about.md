I am a software engineer that enjoys working on the applied math side of computing. The many hats I have worn include "machine learning engineer", "data scientist", "backend engineer", and "research assistant". Today I lead teams in an effort to build products with these techniques that actually deliver value which turns out to be rarer than it should be. I hope to demystify that some.  

I have a deep interest in math and physics and while I dropped out my PhD program I still love to explore on my own schedule, purely for personal pleasure. Writing expository is one of the ways I like to learn and play and I hope to use this site to publish more openly. The subject matter will likely drift as my whims change.
